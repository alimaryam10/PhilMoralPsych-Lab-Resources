# Attention and Comprehension Checks üéØ

## Understanding the Difference

| **Attention Check** | **Comprehension Check** |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------|
| *Were they paying attention?* | *Did they understand?* |

## Types of Checks

### Attention Checks
Simple checks to verify participant engagement:

‚úÖ Examples:
- "For quality assurance, please click '6' from the options below"
- "What's the day after Friday that comes before Sunday?"
- "What did the previous question ask you to do?"

‚úÖ Best practices:
- Keep them simple
- Space them throughout the survey
- Don't make them tricky
- Never use force response

### Comprehension Checks
Verify understanding of materials:

‚úÖ Examples:
- "What were the names of the couple in the vignette?"  
  *Options should include:*
  - Sophie/Paul
  - Paul/Robin
  - Max/Robin
- Questions testing understanding of key concepts
- Verification of scenario details

## Implementation Guidelines

### Placement
- Space checks throughout the survey
- Don't cluster them together
- Consider placing after key information
- Avoid putting them right after consent

### Response Options
- Use clear, unambiguous answers
- Include plausible incorrect options
- Don't make them unnecessarily difficult
- Consider including "I don't know" options

## üö® Exclusion Policies

If you plan to eliminate people from the study entirely (i.e., not pay them) based on failing attention or comprehension checks , a very specific procedure must be met:

**YOU MUST declare this to your participants, BEFORE the experiment begins.**

- You can do this by including a 'Read Carefully' question

- The check MUST be of a specific type and conform to Prolific‚Äôs rules, as detailed here.

**Note:** when setting up the study in Prolific, you have to click ‚Äòmanually approve‚Äô ‚Äì rather than ‚Äòautomatically approve‚Äô‚Äì to be able to deny a submission in the first place.

These procedures do not have to be followed if you intend to pay participants who fail checks but simply intend to exclude their data from analyses.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Please review Prolific rules and regulations regarding participant exclusion (i.e., not accepting submission) where you deny to pay the participants!! (https://researcher-help.prolific.com/en/article/3405a6)

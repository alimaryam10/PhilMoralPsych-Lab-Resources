# Attention and Comprehension Checks üéØ

## Understanding the Difference

| **Attention Check** | **Comprehension Check** |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------|
| *Were they paying attention?* | *Did they understand?* |

## Types of Checks

### Attention Checks
Simple checks to verify participant engagement:

‚úÖ Examples:
- "For quality assurance, please click '6' from the options below"
- "What's the day after Friday that comes before Sunday?"
- "What did the previous question ask you to do?"

‚úÖ Best practices:
- Keep them simple
- Space them throughout the survey
- Don't make them tricky
- Never use force response

### Comprehension Checks
Verify understanding of materials:

‚úÖ Examples:
- "What were the names of the couple in the vignette?"  
  *Options should include:*
  - Sophie/Paul
  - Paul/Robin
  - Max/Robin
- Questions testing understanding of key concepts
- Verification of scenario details

## Implementation Guidelines

### Placement
- Space checks throughout the survey
- Don't cluster them together
- Consider placing after key information
- Avoid putting them right after consent

### Response Options
- Use clear, unambiguous answers
- Include plausible incorrect options
- Don't make them unnecessarily difficult
- Consider including "I don't know" options

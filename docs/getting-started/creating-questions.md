# Creating Questions

## 🚨 Things to Remember Throughout 🚨
> * Group questions into meaningful blocks, considering randomization requirements later on.
> * After any change you make do not forget to click **PUBLISH** on the top right corner.

## Block & Question Naming Conventions
* Your **blocks and questions** should have meaningful, short names that use camel case or snake case (Attention_Check, AttentionCheck)
   * Meaningful short names (like Attention_Check) will be helpful when you download your data, since question names will be column names in your data sheet (e.g., Excel).
   * Do not leave spaces or use special characters (other than . or _) in the names since R will have a hard time reading these[^1].
   * You might benefit from creating a document that indexes how each question is labeled on Qualtrics if multiple colleagues are working on the data analysis separately[^2].
 
     [^1]: Spaces and special characters are the mortal enemies of R.
     [^2]: This will rescue you from playing "What on earth is variable XG_45b??" six months from now.

# Creating Your Survey: The Essentials 

## 🎯 Quick Tips Before You Start
- **Always hit PUBLISH** after making changes (yes, every single time).
- Ctrl + z to undo errors does **not work** with Qualtrics, however, you can recover previous versions to undo mistakes.
- Group questions into meaningful blocks, considering randomization requirements later on.	
- You might benefit from adding a [CAPTCHA](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/advanced/captcha-verification/) or other **Bot Checks**.

## 📋 Naming Your Questions & Blocks

### The Golden Rules of Naming
Think of question names like pet names - they'll stick around forever in your data, so choose wisely.

Use either:
- `snake_case` (attention_check)
- `camelCase` (attentionCheck)

✅ Good names:
- `moral_dilemma_1`
- `consentResponse`
- `age_check`

❌ Bad names (will make R cry):
- `Moral Dilemma 1`
- `consent response!!`
- `age.check.#1`

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Create a question name index in Word if multiple people will analyze the data. Your future self will thank you!

## 🔑 Essential Setup Steps

### 1. Participant Information & Consent

1. Get the latest versions:
   - Ask your lab manager for current PI form
   - Get the most recent consent form template
   
2. Set up consent questions:
   - Always enable "Force Response" (we really need these answers!)
   - Add age verification (18+)
   - Set up branching logic to exit if:
     - Participant doesn't consent
     - Participant is under 18
   
   > 🚨 **Critical!** Check the template to see how to properly set up early exit options

### 2. Organizing Your Questions

Tips for block organization:
- Group similar questions together
- Consider future randomization needs
- Use clear block names (they'll show up in your data)

> 🎭 **Fun fact**: Good organization now means less drama during data analysis later.

## 📝 Remember!
1. PUBLISH after changes (yes, we're saying it again!)
2. Check the template for examples
3. No spaces or special characters in names (except `_` and `.`)
4. Force response for consent questions
5. Test your early exit logic

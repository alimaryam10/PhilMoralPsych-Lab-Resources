## Consent Forms Setup

* Start by creating a question for the participant information sheet and consent form
  
  > 🚨 **PLEASE NOTE**: The information sheet may need to change for your study (for example, if you submit a new ethics application for it). Please ask your lab manager for the most recent version of the PI form and consent form.
     
* Consent questions and similar should always have ["Force Response"](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/validation/) turned on.
* Make sure the **participant leaves the study early** if they do not select "yes I agree" to consent or "yes I am 18 years old" (see template, and check the randomization and logic section of this guide).

 > 💡 **See Template for Examples**
> 
 > The lab Qualtrics template contains examples of properly formatted questions and consent forms that you can use as a reference when building your study.

 >📍Simply go to Qualtrics (login using the lab credentials), and navigate to the 'Projects' tab in the menu on the top left (next to the XM logo). From here, you'll find a folder called "Projects and Programs" - click that to find the study templates.

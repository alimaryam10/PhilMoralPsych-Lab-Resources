# Creating Questions & Consent üìù

## Things to Remember Throughout üö®

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Points ‚ö†Ô∏è
> 
> * Group questions into meaningful blocks, considering randomization requirements later on.
> * After any change you make do not forget to click **PUBLISH** on the top right corner.

* You might benefit from adding a CAPTCHA or other **Bot Checks**
* Your **blocks and questions** should have meaningful, short names that use camel case or snake case (Attention_Check, AttentionCheck)
   * This will be helpful when you download your data, since question names will be column names in your data sheet (e.g., Excel).
   * Do not leave spaces or use special characters (other than . or _) in the names since R will have a hard time reading these.
   * You might benefit from creating a document that indexes how each question is labeled on Qualtrics if multiple colleagues are working on the data analysis separately.

## Consent Forms Setup

* Start by creating a question for the participant information sheet and consent form
   * ‚õ≥Ô∏è**PLEASE NOTE**: The information sheet may need to change for your study. Please ask your lab manager for the most recent version of the PI form and consent form.
* Consent questions and similar should always have "Force Response" turned on.
* Make sure the **participant leaves the study early** if they do not select "yes I agree" to consent or "yes I am 18 years old" (see template).

## See Template for Examples

The lab Qualtrics template contains examples of properly formatted questions and consent forms that you can use as a reference when building your study.

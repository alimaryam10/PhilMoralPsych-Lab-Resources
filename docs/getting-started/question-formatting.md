# Question Formatting

## ðŸš¨ Double-Check Your Value Coding! ðŸš¨
Always verify how Qualtrics has coded your values and choices by:

* Clicking the "recode values" button in Qualtrics
  >- Options like "Strongly agree" on a 5-point scale might be formatted as a random number - you can use recode values to make sure the right number is assigned to the scale values

* If you forgot this step (we've all been there!), check what values were actually coded after downloading your dataset

## Question Formatting Best Practices

### Text Formatting

- Use Rich Text Formatting to make style changes
- Make sure to have different sentences on separate lines for readability 

### For Longer Content

- Always preview vignettes, text blocks, and images before launching
- Ensure everything is easily readable (squinting participants = bad data)
- Properly format any words or sections needing emphasis (e.g., **bold**, *italic* or <u>underlined<u>)

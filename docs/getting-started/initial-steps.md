# Project Setup Guide

## Before You Begin
1. Request access to our template study in Qualtrics:
   - Use this link (make sure you are signed into your Qualtrics account): [Template study](https://practicalethics.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cO6I4XAlvNnQPaK)

     > ðŸ’¡ **When using the template**
     >  - Check that you are accessing the template study as an editor, not as a participant
     >  - Please do not make any edits to this template, use it as a guide
     >  - This will give you an idea of how your survey should look, and will be a helpful reference as you go through this guide

## Setting Up Your Project Structure

### Step 1: Qualtrics Setup
1. Locate or Create Your Project Folder
   - Browse existing folders in Qualtrics
   - A suitable folder might be under your supervisor's name, or course name
   - If no suitable folder exists, create a new one with your name
   - Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Memory_Studies_2025")

2. Name Your Experiment
   - Use this format: `[Study Name] [Type] [Version]`
   - Examples:
     - Pilot: "Biomedical Enhancement Pilot A"
     - Full study: "Bodily Integrity Full Experiment A"
   
   > ðŸ’¡ **Naming Tips**
   > - Pilots: Use letters (A, B, C) for different versions
   > - Full studies: Include "Full Experiment" or "Full Study" + version letter
   > - Keep names consistent within project groups

### Step 2: Google Drive Setup
1. Create a folder in the Lab's Google Drive
   - Use the same name as your Qualtrics project
   - This will store all related documentation

2. Final Documentation (After Study)
   - Save in your Google Drive folder:
     - PDF version of your survey
     - QSF file from Qualtrics
     - Any other relevant materials

# Project Setup Guide

## Before You Begin
1. Request access to our template study in Qualtrics:
   - Use this link (make sure you are signed into your Qualtrics account): [Template study](https://practicalethics.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cO6I4XAlvNnQPaK)

     > 💡 **When using the template**
     >  - Check that you are accessing the template study as an editor, not as a participant
     >  - Please do not make any edits to this template, use it as a guide
     >  - This will give you an idea of how your survey should look, and will be a helpful reference as you go through this guide

## Setting Up Your Project Structure

### Step 1: Qualtrics Setup
1. Locate or Create Your Project Folder
   - Browse existing folders in Qualtrics
   - A suitable folder might be under your supervisor's name, or course name
   - If no suitable folder exists, create a new one with your name
   
2. Name Your Experiment
   - Use this format to create a clear name: `[Study Name] [Type] [Version]`

 > 📛 **[Study Name]:**
 > - Give your study a clear, distinctive name that won't confuse you or other lab members using Qualtrics.
 > - Descriptive names help everyone identify your project easily (e.g., "Wishes of the dead").
  
   > 💡 **[Type] refers to:**
   > - Pilots: Initial test runs to identify issues before the full study
   > - Full studies: The complete experiment after pilot testing
   
   > 📝 **[Version] refers to:**
   > - Iterations of the experiment
   > - Use letters (A, B, C) for different consecutive versions (e.g., Pilot A, Pilot B...)
   
   - Examples:
     - Pilot: "Biomedical Enhancement Pilot A"
     - Full study: "Bodily Integrity Full Experiment A"


### Step 2: Google Drive Setup
1. Create a folder in the Lab's Google Drive
   - Use the same name as your Qualtrics project
   - This will store all related documentation

2. Final Documentation (After Study)
   - Save in your Google Drive folder:
     - PDF version of your survey
     - QSF file from Qualtrics
     - Any other relevant materials

## Quick Reference: Naming Convention
```text
[Study Topic] [Study Type] [Version Letter]
│             │            │
│             │            └── A, B, C for iterations
│             └── Pilot / Full Experiment
└── Brief description of research topic

Example names:
- `Memory Tasks Pilot A`
- `Memory Tasks Full Experiment A`
- `Memory Tasks Pilot B` (if revisions needed)

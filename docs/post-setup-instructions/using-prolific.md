‼️ ***This section is for post-grad students, and others running the surveys on Prolific themselves. 
If you are an undergrad, your PI or lab manager will work through this with you.***

# Using Prolific
*Go to [Prolific](www.prolific.com) and log in with your details*

* Check if there is a project folder 📂 your experiment belongs to under “Projects”.
  >* If not, create a new project folder for your study.
* Consider if your experiment should be desktop only (in most cases we would only want participants to use a desktop)
  >* The number of vignettes, whether you show images etc. can all affect this decision.
  >* If you allow mobile phone usage, it might be good to compare participant data who use mobile phones to participants who use desktop to ensure no significant differences.

## Prolific Links
* Make sure to add the unique link of your experiment (this would be the distribution link Qualtrics gives you) to Prolific
* Make sure you copy and paste the redirection URL Prolific gives you as a **customized end-of-survey message via Survey Flow** in Qualtrics.

## Collecting Prolific IDs
*This is required in order to pay participants*
* Consider how you will collect prolific Id’s (automatic or manual examples on how to do this can be found on the template) 
* If you use URL parameters, make sure the embedded data field that collects the Prolific ID is set up (see template)

## Other Considerations

### Elimination of participants

* Consider if you need to eliminate participants from previous studies, especially if this is a replication.
  >* Prolific automatically offers this to you if you have duplicated your Prolific draft of the pilot to create the full study.

### Participant Payment

* Calculate how much to pay participants by using the average duration you computed before. 
* **Get funding approval from the PI.**

**🚨Go back to Qualtrics and UPDATE your participant information form with the estimated duration and how much you’ll reimburse participants.🚨**


*Consider if you can just automatically approve submissions or if you need to review them. Reviewing submissions manually can help you not waste funds on incomplete etc. trials.

## Pre-publishing Checks
* Check that you have added the correct screeners, number of participants, etc. before pressing publish on Prolific.
* Preview the survey via Prolific (like we do on Qualtrics) all the way through to the end to ensure:
  >*  (1) Prolific directs participants to your survey correctly
  >*  (2) your survey correctly redirects participants back to Prolific
  
⛳️ After you publish the experiment, go to your lab’s funding tracker page and log on to the details of the amount of funds spent.
If you are a student researcher, contact your lab manager / PI for them to log costs on your behalf.

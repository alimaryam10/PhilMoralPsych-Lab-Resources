# Preregistration
*This is a very important step for ensuring reproducibility of your research findings and to protect against p-hacking. We encourage all students to make a pregistration for their study.*

* You can make a preregistration on [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org) - they allow you to make a test preregistration, check it out.

### What about pilots?
* Always run a test pilot **before** preregistration of anything (*N* < 20). Preregister for either your **full study** or **pilot** afterwards.
  >* This data may not be useful for publications.
  >* If the initial pilot has interesting data that you want to include in a study, mention that it is not pre-registered.

## Types of Preregistration
* **Exploratory pre-registrations:** can be useful but you can over constrain yourself. It's okay to have very minimally constraining ones.
* **Directional pre-registrations:** These can be more robust preregistrations where you commit to your hypotheses.
* Read [Daniel Lakens (2024)](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ha29k) for more information on when to deviate from your pre-registration.

## Considerations
* You should have thought about the following -- or have some idea of them -- by the time you make your preregistration:
  >* what kind of test you will run
  >* [effect size](https://www.simplypsychology.org/effect-size.html)
  >* number of conditions
  
## ðŸ’¡ Tips
* When preregistering a sample size, consider adding a 10-15% buffer in anticipation of exclusions to meet your sample size.
  >* Here's an example of this: *"Anticipating exclusions, we'll recruit 400 (or 100 participants per condition)."*
* Be detailed - for example, when describing your DVs, include the full items and rating scale.
* Don't forget to set your alpha - we conventionally set this to .05 for Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).

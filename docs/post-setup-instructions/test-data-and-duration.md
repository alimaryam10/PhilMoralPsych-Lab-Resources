# Test Data and Duration 

## Final Checks
* After you complete setting up the experiment, go through each condition in the experiment at least twice.
* Get **final approval** from the PI of the project.
> Check that you have clicked	“publish” for all changes to be saved again.”Preview” may show changes that in fact will not be shown to participants unless you have clicked “Publish”.

## Study Duration

* Calculate the average duration of the experiment by taking it multiple times and timing yourself or preferably with colleagues/friends who are new to the experiment.

## Test Data
* Generate test data by using the Tools section. 
* Download all the test data you have and start writing your R script ***as if*** it’s the real data.
>* ‼️Only run the actual experiment via Prolific etc. after you have a script that does the correct cleaning and analysis.

🚨**DELETE ALL TEST DATA BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY RUN YOUR SURVEY.**🚨

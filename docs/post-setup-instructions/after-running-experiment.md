# After Running The Experiment

* Manually approve or reject participants if that’s what you selected on Prolific when setting up.
* Download data from Qualtrics.
  >* Consider if you need to download the data as numerical or text.
  >* Consider downloading demographic data from Prolific.
* When downloading data select “export viewing order” for the exported data to show you which person randomly got which of the conditions (you can do this by clicking options)

🚨**Download the raw data and always keep an un-edited copy after anonymization**🚨

## Starting Your Analysis
* Duplicate the anonymized data file to carry out the analysis on the duplicate.
* Return to your experiments page on Prolific to check how long the study actually took
* Check if you underpaid participants and alert PI if you need to top-up.
* Deposit documents to the project's Google Folder

## Rerunning Experiments
*This applies if you have already run your experiment once*

* If you are planning to make modifications to rerun the experiment then:
  >* **Duplicate** the experiment
  >* Make modifications on this **duplicated copy only**
  >* ‼️Leave the original experiment as it is!
